# Time-Series-Prediction-using-RNNs
Final Project for Technion 046211 Deep Learning Course. <br>
We will compare various recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for prediction of dynamic and chaotic time series data. RNNs like long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU) and transformers will be compared with each other and with a novel RNN method called reservoir computing
